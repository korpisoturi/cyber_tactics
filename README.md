My research planning and coordination repository.

Issues contains all the phases related to doctoral studies: Basic studies, research plan, the research phases, thesis defence & ending byrocracy.

Projects contains more detailed follow up and scheduling for each issue.

Wiki contains research plan and memos supporting the research.

Actual texts, essayes etc. are not stored in wiki. This may be cosidered again after the research is done.
